#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :   <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects, which develops intuition, and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| See the displayed objectives and apparatus used then click on next button | Display objective and apparatus used | Recall the experiment
2.| Select either of the material displayed, click on cement then click on next button | Display choose the type of material | To provide basic environment to start the experiment
3.| Note down the weight, click on next button | Display weigh the clean and dry Le-Chatelier flask with its stopper | To obtain the empty weight of the flask
4.| Click on the stopper to open it and then click on hand with cement setup to add cement (almost 64g) into the flask, click on the stopper again to place it in its position and then click on Le-Chateliers flask to place it on weighing machine, i.e. (W<sub>2</sub>), click on next button | Display remove the stopper and add weighed amount of cement, then weigh the flask with stopper | To obtain the weight of cement
5.| Now open the stopper by clicking on it then click on beaker to pour kerosene into it (W<sub>3</sub>) | Display add kerosene to the flask up to the graduated mark and shake it well to remove air bubbles | To obtain the weight of cement along with kerosene
6.| Repeat the above steps and add only kerosene to the flask (W<sub>4</sub>), then click next button | Display add kerosene to Le-Chatelier’s flask up to graduated mark and weigh it | To obtain the weight of kerosene
7.| Same way add water to the flask and then click on it to place it in weighing machine (W<sub>5</sub>) | Display add water to Le-Chatelier's flask up to graduated mark and weigh it | To obtain the weight of water
8.| Click on next button to get the observation and then enter the calculated specific gravity value and repeat the same steps for further trials to obtain average specific gravity | Display repeat the same procedure for further trials | To obtain the specific gravity of cement
